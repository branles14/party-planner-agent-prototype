# Party Planner Agent Prototype

This project demonstrates a simple interaction with an Ollama language model.

## Running the demo

Install the dependencies and launch the Gradio interface:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

This will start a local web server where you can enter a prompt and see the
model's response in your browser.
